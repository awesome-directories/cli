```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

2. Go to the GitHub repository and create a Pull Request
3. Fill in the PR template with:
   - Description of changes
   - Related issues (if any)
   - Testing performed
   - Screenshots (if applicable)

## Code Style Guidelines

### Go Code Style

- Follow standard Go formatting (`go fmt`)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for exported functions and types
- Keep functions focused and concise
- Handle errors appropriately

### Project Structure

```
cli/
├── cmd/awesome-directories/  # Main CLI entry point
├── internal/                 # Internal packages
│   ├── api/                  # Supabase API client
│   ├── auth/                 # Authentication logic
│   ├── cache/                # Caching mechanism
│   ├── config/               # Configuration management
│   ├── export/               # Export functionality
│   └── ui/                   # Terminal UI helpers
└── pkg/models/               # Public data models
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
go test -v ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -v -cover ./...

# Run specific package tests
go test -v ./internal/cache
```

### Writing Tests

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Aim for good test coverage
- Use table-driven tests where appropriate
- Mock external dependencies (API calls, file system, etc.)

Example test:

```go
func TestCacheValidation(t *testing.T) {
	tests := []struct {
		name     string
		age      time.Duration
		expected bool
	}{
		{"Fresh cache", 1 * time.Hour, true},
		{"Expired cache", 25 * time.Hour, false},
	}

	for _, tt := range tests {
		t.Run(tt.name, func(t *testing.T) {
			// Test implementation
		})
	}
}
```
